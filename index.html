    </div>
    <div id="Attributes">
        <h2>Attributes:</h2>
        <p>Attributes are used to expand element's tags. Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be in several different ways, from providing information to changing styling.</p>
        <p>Attributes consists of 2 parts:<br>
        The name of the attribute<br>
        And the value of the attribute.</p>
        <p>I am mainly focusing on "id" for now to specify different content divs</p>
    </div>
    <div id="DisplayingText">
        <h2>Displaying Text:</h2>
        <p>Text can be displayed using paragraphs "p" or by using "span"</p>
        <h3>Span</h3>
        <p><span>"Span"</span> contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="StylingText">
        <h2>Styling Text:</h2>
        <p>You can perform italics on certain text by adding <em>"em"</em> in open and close tags or bold text by adding <strong>"strong"</strong> between open and close tags.</p>

    <div id="Images">
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>This is used by the element "img" and is a self closing tag.</p>
        <p>eg. "< img scr = "image-location.jpg" / >"</p>
        <p>Img tage requires an attribute called "scr" which is source which is the URL of the content</p>
        <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbear.jpg" alt="Brown Bear"/> 
        <h3>Image Alts</h3>  
        <p>Adding an "alt" attribute tag brings meaning to the image and is added to the "img" tag just like "src". "alt" describes the image.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Videos">
        <h2>Videos</h2>
        <p>Similar to the "img" tag, the "video" tag does the same but for video.</p>
        <p>However, it is not a single tag element and requires opening and closing tags.</p>
        <p>eg. "< video src = " myVideo.mp4 " width="320" height="240" controls> <br>
            Video not supported <br>
          < / video >"</p>
        <p>After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser. The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls: pause, play and skip</p>
        <p>The text, “Video not supported", between the opening and closing video tags will only be displayed if the browser is unable to load the video.</p>
        <video scr="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-1/lesson-2/htmlcss1-vid_brown-bear.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>

        <h2>Tables</h2>
        <p>This is done by using the element "table".</p>
        <p>"tr" element is used to add a row.</p>
        <p>To add data in the cell, use the element "td".</p>
        <p>To use title headings, use the element "th" and the "scope" attribute to equate to "row" or "col"</p>
        <p>Data can span to multiple columns or take up multiple cells, this can be accounted for by the attribute "colspan" which takes an integer to give the number of columns it spans across.</p>
        <p>Data can also span multiple rows using the attribute "rowspan"</p>
        <p>Table can be separated to table body using the "tbody" element, table head using the "thead" element and table footer using the "tfoot" element.</p>

    <div id="Forms">
        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <p>Forms can be used to collect information, to create a form, the element "form" is used.</p>
        <p>The "form" element contains 2 attributes, "action" and "method". action determines where the information is sent, eg "/RelativePage.html" and method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request.(eg. "POST")</p>
        <form action="/RelativePage.html" method="POST">
            <h3>Form:</h3>
            <p>This is a form.</p>
            
            <h5>Text Input</h5>
            <p>To input text or information, an "input" element is used, the input element has an attribute of  "type" which determines how it renders on a webpage and what kind of data it can accept. (eg. "text"). The input element also contains a "name" attribute as without the name attribute the information in the input won't be sent when the form is submitted.</p>
            <p>Note: the "input" element does not need closing tags.</p>
            <h4>For instance</h4>
            <input type="text" name="Name">
            
            <p>The input element also has an attribute of "value" which stores the inputted message and is paired with the name attribute to send to its location stored in the <em>action</em> attribute. The value attribute can also be pre-filled.</p>
            <input type="text" name="Surname" value="information Here">
            
            <h5>Adding Labels</h5>
            <p>Though we added an input, it needs to be labelled, this is done by the "label" element, also a "for" attribute is added to "label" to associate the label with the input, an "id" attribute is added to the "input" element to link to the label using the <em>for</em> attribute.</p>
            <label for="username">Username</label>

            <p>To limit the data being entered into a field as just number and some odd characters like (+, -, .) the <em>type</em> attribute can be set to "number", also adding a "step" attribute and setting it to "1" can allow for an arrow menu to select numbers</p>
            <label for="EnterNumber">Enter Number</label>
            <input type="number" name="EnterNumber" id="EnterNumber" step="1">
            <p>To limit the range of numbers used, the type "range" can be use and the maximum and minimum numbers can be set using the "min" and "max" attribute in the <em>input</em> element (this would create a slider). Also adding a "step" attribute can impliment and giving a lower number can make the slider more fluid and a larger number makes the slider more noticable.</p>

            <h2>Section and Horizontal line separation</h2>
            <p>"section" is an element used to represent a standalone section for which a more specific element can't be found.This usually has a heading as a child element. A section should make sense in the outline of a document, whereas <em>div</em> is used for styling.</p>
            <p>"class" is a global attribute that has a list of classes pertaining to an element.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>"hr" is an element that is used to a break between paragraph-level elements. It is displayed as a horizontal line. (Like above and below.)</p>

To group radio buttons together, we assign them the same name and only one radio button from that group can be selected.</p>

            <p>While <em>select</em>> and <em>datalist</em> share some similarities, there are some major differences.

            <h3>Checking Text Length</h3>
            <p>In the previous exercise, we were able to use <em>min</em> and <em>max</em> to set acceptable minimum and maximum values in a number field. But what about text fields? There are certainly cases where we wouldn’t want our users typing more than a certain number of characters (think about the character cap for messages on Twitter). We might even want to set a minimum number of characters. Conveniently, there are built-in HTML5 validations for these situations. <br>To set a minimum number of characters for a text field, we add the "minlength" attribute and a value to set a minimum value. Similarly, to set the maximum number of characters for a text field, we use the "maxlength" attribute and set a maximum value.</p>
            <form action="/RelativePage.html" method="POST">
                <label for="MaxMinText">Maximum and Minumum text between 5 and 10 words:</label>
                <input id="MaxMinText" name="MaxMinText" type="text" minlength="5" maxlength="10" required> 
                <input type="submit">
            </form>
        </section>
        <section class="MatchingPatterns">
            <h3>Matching Patterns</h3>
            <p>We could also add a validation to check how the text was provided. For cases when we want user input to follow specific guidelines, we use the "pattern" attribute and assign it a regular expression, or regex. Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that make up a search pattern. If the input matches the regex, the form can be submitted.</p>
            <p>Let’s say we wanted to check for a valid credit card number (a 14 to 16 digit number). We could use the regex: [0-9]{14,16} which checks that the user provided only numbers and that they entered at least 14 digits and at most 16 digits.</p>
            <form action="/RelativePage.html" method="POST">
                <label for="pattern">Matching a pattern:</label>
                <input id="pattern" name="pattern" type="text" required pattern="[0-9] {14,16}">
                <input type="submit">
            </form>
            <p>We might also want to limit usernames to only letters and numbers (and not special characters like ! or @).
                To add this validation, add a pattern attribute and set it to: "[a-zA-Z0-9]+" in the first <em>input</em> element.</p>

    <div id="SemanticHTML">
        <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
        <p>When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic HTML and Semantic HTML. The word semantic means “relating to meaning,” so semantic elements provide information about the content between the opening and closing tags. By using Semantic HTML, we select HTML elements based on their meaning, not on how they are presented. Elements such as <em>div</em> and <em>span</em> are not semantic elements since they provide no context as to what is inside of those tags.</p>

            <header>
                <h3>Header and Nav</h3>
                <h4>Header</h4>
                <p>A "header" is a container usually for either navigational links or introductory content containing <em>h1</em> to <em>h6</em> headings.</p>
                <h4>Nav</h4>
                <p>A "nav" is used to define a block of navigation links such as menus and tables of contents. It is important to note that "nav" can be used inside of the <em>header</em> element but can also be used on its own.</p>
                <nav>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#Validation">Validation</a></li>

            <h3>Main and Footer</h3>
            <h4>Main</h4>
            <main>
                <p>The element "main" is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage. This tag is separate from the "footer" and the <em>nav</em> of a web page since these elements don’t contain the principal content. By using "main" as opposed to a <em>div</em> element, screen readers and web browsers are better able to identify that whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the content. As we see above, "main" contains an <em>article</em> and <em>header</em> tag with child elements that hold the most important information related to the page.</p>
            </main>
            <h3>Footer</h3>
            <p>The content at the bottom of the subject information is known as the footer, indicated by the "footer" element. The footer contains information such as:</p>
            <footer>  
                <ul>
                    <li>Contact information</li>
                    <li>Copyright information</li>
                    <li>Terms of use</li>

        <section class="ArticleAndSection">
            <article>
                <h2>Article and Section</h2>
                <h3>Section</h3>
                <p>"section" defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme. For example, content with the same theme such as articles about cricket can go under a single "section". A website’s home page could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.</p>
                <h3>Article</h3>
                <p>The "article" element holds content that makes sense on its own. "article" can hold content such as articles, blogs, comments, magazines, etc. An "article" tag would help someone using a screen reader understand where the article content (that might contain a combination of text, images, audio, etc.) begins and ends.</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="Aside">
            <aside>
                <h2>Aside Element</h2>
                <p>The "aside" element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isn’t required in order to understand the main content. This element can be used alongside other elements such as <em>article</em> or <em>section</em>. Some common uses of the "aside" element are for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bibliographies</li>
                    <li>Endnotes</li>
                    <li>Comments</li>
                    <li>Pull quotes</li>
                    <li>Editorial sidebars</li>
                    <li>Additional information</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: The information within the <em>article</em> is the important content. Meanwhile the information within the "aside" enhances the information in <em>article</em> but is not required in order to understand it.</p>
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section class="FigureAndFigcaption">
            <h2>Figure and Figcaption</h2>
            <h3>Figure</h3>
            <p>"figure" is an element used to encapsulate media such as an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc, which is referenced in the main flow of the document.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/SemanticHTML/dogimage.jpeg">
            </figure>
            <h3>Figcapture</h3>
            <p>"figcaption" is an element used to describe the media in the <em>figure</em> tag. Usually, "figcaption" will go inside <em>figure</em>. This is different than using a <em>p</em> element to describe the content; if we decide to change the location of <em>figure</em>, the paragraph tag may get displaced from the figure while a "figcaption" will move with the figure. This is useful for grouping an image with a caption.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/SemanticHTML/dogimage.jpeg">
                <figcaption>Shinny Doggo</figcaption>

        <section class="AudioAndAttrubutes">
            <h2>Audio and Attributes</h2>
            <h3>Audio</h3>
            <p>The "audio" element is used to embed audio content into a document. Like <em>video</em>, "audio" uses src to link the audio source.</p>
            <audio>
                <source src="iAmAnAudioFile.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>
            <p>In this example, we created an "audio" element. Then we created a "source" element to encapsulate our audio link. In this case, iAmAnAudioFile.mp3 is our audio file. Then we specified the type by using "type" and named what kind of audio it is. Although not always necessary, it’s recommended that we state the type of audio as it helps the browser identify it more easily and determine if that type of audio file is supported by the browser.</p>
            <p>We linked our audio file into the browser but now we need to give it controls. This is where attributes come in. Attributes provide additional information about an element. Attributes allow us to do many different things to our audio file. There are many attributes for "audio" but today we’re going to be focusing on controls and src.</p>
            <h4>controls</h4>
            <p>Automatically displays the audio controls into the browser such as play and mute.</p>
            <h4>scr</h4>
            <p>Specifies the URL of the audio file.</p>
            <h4>autoplay</h4>
            <h4>crossorigin</h4>
            <h4>anonymous</h4>
            <h4>use-credentials</h4>
            <h4>disableremoteplayback</h4>
            <h4>loop</h4>
            <h4>muted</h4>
            <h4>preload</h4>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/SemanticHTML/dogBarking.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>
        </section>
        <section class="VideoAndEmbed">
            <h2>Video and Embed</h2>
            <h3>Video</h3>
            <p>As demonstrated in the previous exercise, media content can be a useful addition to a website. By using a "video" element, we can add videos to our website. The "video" element makes it clear that a developer is attempting to display a video to the user. Some attributes that can alter a video playback include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>controls</li>
                <p>When added in, a play/pause button will be added onto the video along with volume control and a fullscreen option.</p>
                <li>autoplay</li>
                <p>The attribute which results in a video automatically playing as soon as the page is loaded.</p>
                <li>loop</li>
                <p>This attribute results in the video continuously playing on repeat.</p>
            </ul>
            <video src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/SemanticHTML/dog-video.mp4" controls>Video Not Supported</video>
            <h3>Embed</h3>
            <p>Another tag that can be used to incorporate media content into a page is the "embed" tag, which can embed any media content including videos, audio files, and gifs from an external source. This means that websites that have an embed button have some form of media content that can be added to other websites. The "embed" tag is a self-closing tag, unlike the <em>video</em>> element. Note that "embed" is a deprecated tag and other alternatives, such as <em>video</em>, <em>audio</em> and <em>img</em>, should be used in its place, but is being taught for legacy purposes.</p>
