        <p>This is used by the element "img" and is a self closing tag.</p>
        <p>eg. "< img scr = "image-location.jpg" / >"</p>
        <p>Img tage requires an attribute called "scr" which is source which is the URL of the content</p>
        <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbear.jpg" alt="Brown Bear"/> 
        <h3>Image Alts</h3>

    </div>
    <div id="Videos">
        <h2>Videos</h2>
        <p>Similar to the "img" tag, the "video" tag does the same but for video.</p>
        <p>However, it is not a single tag element and requires opening and closing tags.</p>
        <p>eg. "< video src = " myVideo.mp4 " width="320" height="240" controls> <br>
            Video not supported <br>
          < / video >"</p>
        <p>After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser. The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls: pause, play and skip</p>
        <p>The text, â€œVideo not supported", between the opening and closing video tags will only be displayed if the browser is unable to load the video.</p>
        <video scr="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-1/lesson-2/htmlcss1-vid_brown-bear.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
        Video not supported</video>
