        <h2>Videos</h2>
        <p>Similar to the "img" tag, the "video" tag does the same but for video.</p>
        <p>However, it is not a single tag element and requires opening and closing tags.</p>
        <p>eg. "< video src = " myVideo.mp4 " width="320" height="240" controls> <br>
            Video not supported <br>
          < / video >"</p>
        <p>After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser. The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls: pause, play and skip</p>
        <p>The text, â€œVideo not supported", between the opening and closing video tags will only be displayed if the browser is unable to load the video.</p>
        <video scr="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-1/lesson-2/htmlcss1-vid_brown-bear.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>

    <div id="Forms">
        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <p>Forms can be used to collect information, to create a form, the element "form" is used.</p>
        <p>The "form" element contains 2 attributes, "action" and "method". action determines where the information is sent, eg "/RelativePage.html" and method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request.(eg. "POST")</p>
        <form action="/RelativePage.html" method="POST">
            <h3>Form:</h3>
            <p>This is a form.</p>
            
            <h5>Text Input</h5>
            <p>To input text or information, an "input" element is used, the input element has an attribute of  "type" which determines how it renders on a webpage and what kind of data it can accept. (eg. "text"). The input element also contains a "name" attribute as without the name attribute the information in the input won't be sent when the form is submitted.</p>
            <p>Note: the "input" element does not need closing tags.</p>
            <h4>For instance</h4>
            <input type="text" name="Name">
            
            <p>The input element also has an attribute of "value" which stores the inputted message and is paired with the name attribute to send to its location stored in the <em>action</em> attribute. The value attribute can also be pre-filled.</p>
            <input type="text" name="Surname" value="information Here">
            
            <h5>Adding Labels</h5>
            <p>Though we added an input, it needs to be labelled, this is done by the "label" element, also a "for" attribute is added to "label" to associate the label with the input, an "id" attribute is added to the "input" element to link to the label using the <em>for</em> attribute.</p>
            <label for="username">Username</label>
            <input type="text" name="Username" id="username">
        </form>
    </div>
    <div id="Forms-Password">
        <form action="/RelativePage.html" method="POST">
            <h5>Password Input</h5>
            <p>For sensitive information such as pins or passwords use the type = "password" to conceal the information being entered.</p>
            <label for="password">Password</label>
            <input type="password" name="password" id="password">
        </form>
    </div>
    <div id="Form-NumberType">
        <form action="/RelativePage.html" method="POST">
            <h5>Number Input</h5>
            <p>To limit the data being entered into a field as just number and some odd characters like (+, -, .) the <em>type</em> attribute can be set to "number", also adding a "step" attribute and setting it to "1" can allow for an arrow menu to select numbers</p>
            <label for="EnterNumber">Enter Number</label>
            <input type="number" name="EnterNumber" id="EnterNumber" step="1">
